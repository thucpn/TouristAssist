Development of fees\\nPrinciples\\nAlthough the fees charged for services provided to Compensable, Medicare ineligible and\\nother chargeable patients form a small portion of the overall funding to NT Health in the\\nNorthern Territory (NT), they are important for the sustainability of these services. This\\nRegister has been developed with the following principles in mind:\\nï· Transparency\\nï· Equity and Efficiency\\nï· Authority\\nï· Rights and Responsibilities of the Health Service and Patients\\nTransparency\\nThe Register endeavours to clearly articulate the application of fees in terms of who is\\nchargeable, the amount to be charged and for which goods and services.\\nEquity and Efficiency\\nFees are determined based on a balance between access to sustainable health services\\nand the costs of providing those services. Fees are reviewed annually against the latest\\npublished costing data, specific to the NT, and aggregated to categories based on\\ncharacteristics of the patient or location where services are delivered, in a framework\\nthat reflects an equitable recovery of costs in the most administratively efficient means.\\nAuthority\\nFees published in this Register are underpinned by national and Northern Territory\\nlegislation and approved and gazetted by the NT Minister for Health under the NT\\nMedical Services Act.\\nRights and Responsibilities\\nNT Health is committed to the rights and needs of individuals in the public health system\\nunder the Public Hospital Charter. Health services where charges apply must be paid in\\nfull by the responsible party. NT Health will always provide access to emergency health\\ncare, regardless of the financial category of the patient or capacity to pay.\\n3.1. Application of fees\\nUnder the Medical Services Act, the fees in this Register are to be charged in full for all\\napplicable services. Only the Minister for Health and the Chief Executive of NT Health\\nare able to remit these charges. NT Health staff do not have the authority to manually\\namend charges and should not be asked to do so.\\nIf a patient becomes subject to financial charges as a result of receiving treatment in a\\nlocation or ward which is not standard hospital procedure (due to managing hospital\\npatient flow or other once off events), then those charges will not apply. Standard\\naccommodation rates will apply.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"NoyvpptrNXiu2Vo14aw7bUUwU3XB3w8BmeMfcZO4SGc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/territory-services/health-services-fee.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/territory-services/health-services-fee.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"total_pages\":72,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\thucpn\\\\Desktop\\\\nt-govhack\\\\data\\\\territory-services\\\\health-services-fee.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"health-services-fee.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"NT Health Services Fees and Charges Register\\nAdmitted patients\\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Page 10 of 72\\n1/07/2024\\n4.

Health Services Fees and Charges Register\\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Page 9 of 72\\n1/07/2024\\n3.Development of fees\\nPrinciples\\nAlthough the fees charged for services provided to Compensable, Medicare ineligible and\\nother chargeable patients form a small portion of the overall funding to NT Health in the\\nNorthern Territory (NT), they are important for the sustainability of these services.This\\nRegister has been developed with the following principles in mind:\\nï· Transparency\\nï· Equity and Efficiency\\nï· Authority\\nï· Rights and Responsibilities of the Health Service and Patients\\nTransparency\\nThe Register endeavours to clearly articulate the application of fees in terms of who is\\nchargeable, the amount to be charged and for which goods and services.Equity and Efficiency\\nFees are determined based on a balance between access to sustainable health services\\nand the costs of providing those services.Fees are reviewed annually against the latest\\npublished costing data, specific to the NT, and aggregated to categories based on\\ncharacteristics of the patient or location where services are delivered, in a framework\\nthat reflects an equitable recovery of costs in the most administratively efficient means.Authority\\nFees published in this Register are underpinned by national and Northern Territory\\nlegislation and approved and gazetted by the NT Minister for Health under the NT\\nMedical Services Act.Rights and Responsibilities\\nNT Health is committed to the rights and needs of individuals in the public health system\\nunder the Public Hospital Charter.Health services where charges apply must be paid in\\nfull by the responsible party.NT Health will always provide access to emergency health\\ncare, regardless of the financial category of the patient or capacity to pay.3.1.Application of fees\\nUnder the Medical Services Act, the fees in this Register are to be charged in full for all\\napplicable services.Only the Minister for Health and the Chief Executive of NT Health\\nare able to remit these charges.NT Health staff do not have the authority to manually\\namend charges and should not be asked to do so.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"LVBQ5xWO6yZBK8whKPTbCCd29UqBGzxNvrxQhwxwk3k=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"635e99f2-fb78-45bf-b864-4b75773d09b8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"635e99f2-fb78-45bf-b864-4b75773d09b8\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":72,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\thucpn\\\\Desktop\\\\nt-govhack\\\\data\\\\territory-services\\\\health-services-fee.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"health-services-fee.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/territory-services/health-services-fee.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":72,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\thucpn\\\\Desktop\\\\nt-govhack\\\\data\\\\territory-services\\\\health-services-fee.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"health-services-fee.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"NoyvpptrNXiu2Vo14aw7bUUwU3XB3w8BmeMfcZO4SGc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f0098a3a-4ddc-4b56-b508-a1ae93571352\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":72,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\thucpn\\\\Desktop\\\\nt-govhack\\\\data\\\\territory-services\\\\health-services-fee.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"health-services-fee.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"LVBQ5xWO6yZBK8whKPTbCCd29UqBGzxNvrxQhwxwk3k=\"}},\"text\":\"If

support, e.g.awaiting home modifications or equipment.Respite care is where the primary reason for admission is the short-term unavailability of\\nthe patient's usual care.Examples may include:\\nï·

improve access to primary care in rural remote areas, the Australian Government will\\nallow Medicare benefits to be claimed in respect of bulk-billed, non-admitted, non-\\nreferred professional services provided in Emergency Departments and outpatient clinics\\nat some small rural hospitals.This includes nursing and allied health services.This situation existed prior to the National Health Reform.The Australian Government\\nsupports six exempt sites in the Northern Territory: Gove District and Tennant Creek\\nHospitals, Adelaide River, Batchelor, Jabiru and Yulara health centres.It is important to note that these are public patient services that are claimed against the\\nMBS under a Section 19(2) exemption.So whilst the public hospital employed doctor\\nproviding the service requires a valid provider number for claiming MBS benefits, they do\\nnot require rights of private practice.17.6.Multiple visits on the same day/ attendances during\\nthe same episode/ attendances for admittance as inpatient\\nsubsequent to Inter-Hospital Transfer\\nThe possibility exists that a person may attend, or be admitted to, and discharged from a\\nhospital more than once in the same day.Hospitals may charge for every outpatient attendance for chargeable patients.This\\nmeans hospitals can charge for the following:\\nï· Multiple same-day outpatient hospital attendance;\\nï· Outpatient attendances when the patient is subsequently admitted.Hospitals may also charge for an Emergency Department (ED) and an Outpatient\\nattendance on the same day.When a chargeable patient attends ED multiple times in one day (within 24 hours) for the\\nsame injury/ illness, only one emergency account is raised, being the first ED episode of\\nthat 24 hour period from the time of the
